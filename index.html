         <h1>My First Secret Menu</h1>
         <p>I work as a bartender at a restaurant called Louie Louie in Philadelphia. When I first started, I didn't think it would be something I would necessarily be good at, but with the guidance of others I was able to continually improve and now it's something I feel pretty comfortable doing.  One of the things I love most about working at Louie is the freedom I have to be creative with cocktails.  It was definitely awkward for me at first, but now I can kind of come up with drinks for people on the fly!  Since these cocktails I've made other menus, but here are some of my first ones that I was proud of.  The names for this menu are inspired by movie quotes.  I'll also be including the recipes for these cocktails if you'd like to make any of them at home.  Enjoy :)

                  2oz Dewars,
                  0.75oz Don Ciccio walnut liqueur,
                  0.75oz lime juice,
                  0.75oz maple simple syrup,
                  1oz pear nectar,
                  Malbec floater.

                  This cocktail is interesting in a few different ways.  Primarily, it challenges the concept of walnuts and wine not mixing well.  I was nervous about that when I was making it, but it works surprisingly well in the drink! Additionally, scotch is generally seen as a relatively unaproachable alcohol, but by putting it in a mixed drink I was able to make it more approachable to people who don't necessarily like drinking it in the traditional "on the rocks or neat" style.  The notes of dark fruit from the wine and the pear nectar pair(ha) well together, while the walnut and maple work in harmony to create a nice fall spice flavor.  The cocktail as a whole is able to subdue the spiciness of the scotch, without absolutely killing it with sweetness. The toughest part is getting the wine to sit on top!

                  2oz Vicio mezcal,
                  0.25oz cranberry juice,
                  0.5oz orange juice,
                  0.75oz lime juice,
                  0.75oz agave simple syrup,
                  0.75oz triple sec,
                  garnish with a charred grapefruit wheel.

                  If there's something you should know about me, it's that my favorite liquor is tequila, and that extends to Mezcal which is made from the same plant.  It actually combines my two favorites, whiskey and tequila, bringing the smokiness of whiskey over to the versatility of tequila.  I used cranberry juice and orange juice here not only to give a good color to the drink and to make the smokey mezcal more approachable, but also because it's a kind of DIY substitute for blood orange juice.  So if you happen to have that, feel free to sub that in!  It's sort of a play on a paloma or margarita.  This cocktail is a fresh take on a tried and true classic!  Don't let the pink color fool you... this cutie bites back >:)

                  2oz Dad's Hat rye whiskey,
                  1oz apple cider,
                  0.5oz lemon juice,
                  0.75oz honey cinnamon simple syrup,
                  0.5oz Allspice Dram,
                  (optional 0.75oz Cynar artichoke liqueur),
                  eggwhite (it's not scary I promise!),
                  garnish with cinnamon sugar.

                  This drink uses my favorite rye whiskey.  It's local to Pennsylvania (Bristol, PA) which makes it even better! I was first introduced to it when I was working at the White Dog Cafe.  By itself, it's definitely not for everyone, as it's very spicy on the front end and has an almost malty finish.  There are a lot of different variants of it though, so I'd definitely recommend giving it a try!  This drink is sort of a modified whiskey sour, heavily leaning towards that fall spice pallette with notes of apples, cinnamon and allspice.  Adding Cynar will give it a slightly bitter counter flavor, but the drink works really well without it!  Definitely a great option for people who aren't sure if they like whiskey.  The eggwhite mellows out the spiciness even further, transforming the otherwise harsh flavor into something with an almost creamy mouthfeel.  This is a drink you have to try to believe!  If you have any questions about using eggwhites in drinks, definitely feel free to ask me about it.

                  1oz pear nectar,
                  0.75oz lemon juice,
                  0.75 maple simple,
                  (optional 0.75oz Fruitlabs ginger liqueur),
                  garnish with a torched cinnamon stick.

                  This drink uses another Pennsylvania local liquor, Bluecoat gin.  The normal variety displays a crisp citrus character, but this drink uses the barrel aged variant which has a more complex oakiness quality.  We didn't have any at the bar, but you could use my favorite gin instead, Barr Hill Tomcat gin (it's made using Vermont raw honey, definitely keep an eye out for it!).  This drink is probably the most "normal" on the list.  Pears, maple syrup and a little citrus, what more could you ask for.  It's almost too easy to drink... so be careful with this one.

                  0.5oz creme de cacao,
                  0.5oz caramelized simple syrup,
                  1oz cold brew concentrate,
                  garnish with nutmeg or cinnamon sugar, chocolate syrup design at the bottom of the glass.

               <p>
                  To finish off the menu, this is a great after dinner drink.  It's basically dessert in a glass.  It blends two classic cocktails, a chocolate martini and an espresso martini.  The reason I used cold brew concentrate though, is because you get the same coffee flavor you get out of espresso, without having to shake with something hot and thereby diluting the drink when the ice melts.  Perfectly rich, creamy, and chocolatey without being too sweet because of the coffee... This one sells itself.
